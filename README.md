# About #
This is a basic python code to retrieve data behind trajectories plotted on the Google Books Ngram Viewer: books.google.com/ngrams.

Just type exactly the same string you would have type on books.google.com/ngrams, and retrieve the data in tsv format. By default, data is printed on screen and saved to file in the current directory.

 1. You can directly pass queries as arguments to the python script, such as "python getngrams.py awesome".
 2. If you pass the '-quit' flag as an argument, the program will run once and quit without asking for more input, such as "python getngrams.py awesome, sauce -quit".     
 3. Known caveat: quotation marks are removed from the input query. 

### Example Usage ###

```
python getngrams.py Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin
python getngrams.py Pearl Harbor, Watergate -corpus=eng_2009 -nosave 
python getngrams.py bells and whistles -startYear=1900 -endYear=2001 -smoothing=2
python getngrams.py aluminum, copper, steel -noprint -quit
```

### Flags ###
  * **corpus** [default: eng_2012] *This will run the query in CORPUS. Possible values are recapitulated below and [here](http://books.google.com/ngrams/info)*
  * **startYear** [default: 1800]
  * **endYear** [default: 2000]
  * **smoothing** [default: 3] *Smoothing parameter (integer). Minimum is 0.*
  * **nosave** *Results will not be saved to file*
  * **noprint** *Results will not be printed on screen*
  * **help** *Prints this screen*
  * **quit** *Quits after running query*

### Possible Corpora ###

```
eng_2012, eng_2009, eng_us_2012, eng_us_2009, eng_gb_2012, eng_gb_2009, chi_sim_2012, chi_sim_2009, fre_2012, fre_2009, ger_2012, ger_2009, spa_2012, spa_2009, rus_2012, rus_2009, heb_2012, heb_2009, ita_2012, eng_fiction_2012, eng_fiction_2009, eng_1m_2009
```

### Plotting ###
One way to plot data from a .tsv file created from the getngrams.py script is
to read the .tsv file into a pandas DataFrame object and call the .plot()
option on it.

For example, open an IPython terminal in the directory with a .tsv file with a
pylab inline plotting backend (e.g. ipython --pylab=inline). Then you can do
something like the following to produce a plot:

```python
import pandas
df = pandas.read_csv('aluminum_copper_steel_zinc-eng_2012-1800-2000-3.tsv', sep='\t', index_col=0)
df.plot()
```

which will produce an image like this:
